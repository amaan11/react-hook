### React Hook

Class Components are complex and sometimes it become difficult to decompose calss component into smaller component.Hence the functionbal component is best to use

But there comes a problem 
State and lifecycles method cannot be used in functional component
To rescue,Lifecycle hooks are used in which local value are stored using useState() method
